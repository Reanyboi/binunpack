# binunpack
A program for unpacking the BIN archives in DragonBall Revenge of King Piccolo, written in python 3.

# How To Use
The syntax of the program is simple:

```
binextract.py <infile>
```

then the program will export the files (all will be binary files, there is no pointer table for filenames, sadly) to a folder, relative where the python script is placed.
